                <p> I am a scientist and inventor with an eye for nature. My vision is to build seamless interactive platforms for physical and computational modeling using physical models governed by their shape, dynamics and functions. This work integrates with high performance computing (HPC), scientific computing and data science. With some help from 3D printers, I want to precisely design and build scientifically accurate physical models of nano- to macro-scale biological and other natural systems, which explore unsolved scientific problems (e.g. the Protein Folding Problem). Under this broad umbrella, I invented <a href="http://www.peppytides.org/">Peppytides</a> and initiated a new field called Physical Biomodeling as a part of my <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/47932">doctoral work</a>, and then generalized these concepts, expanding to a new field, <i>Physical Scientific Computing and Modeling</i>. My epertise is in building scientific tools and models that measure and compute with help from accurate, scaled, dynamic physical models. I am currently working on building physical dynamic models for the human brain.</p>

		<font color="red"><b>Bio</b></font><p>
                <p>Dr. Promita Chakraborty is a scientist and inventor who has initiated a new field called <i>Physical Scientific Computing and Modeling</i> (a special initial case being <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04687">Physical Biomodeling</a> that she initiated during her doctoral work). It is an unexplored space of study at the intersection of natural sciences, computational science and precision physical models. With the help of 3D printing technology and her vision for accurate dynamic folding macromolecules, she invented Peppytides. This is her first prototype model to demonstate the necessity of this direction of study. It a to-scale physical model of the polypeptide chain that can fold into various motifs and secondary & tertiary structures of proteins. Because of its flexibility and accurate scaling, Peppytides is a model that is first of its kind. 

<p>She received her PhD in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in 2014. After PhD she founded QuezyLab, a research-based-startup company, to connect the digital and the physical world of scientific computing. 

<p>She has coined the terms Peppytides, PeppyChains, Physical Biomodeling, Physical Scientific Computing, and QuezyLab, and is on her way to ePeppytides and more.

<p>She has worked as a Research Associate at the <a href="http://foundry.lbl.gov/">Molecular Foundry</a> at  <a href="http://www.lbl.gov/">Berkeley Lab (LBNL)</a> (2011-2014). During her time at Virginia Tech (2008-2011) and then at Berkeley Lab, she initiated and implemented the Peppytide project to study protein folding; this is a vision that she had carried forward from her reflections, realizations and research experiences at LSU (2005-2008) where she did her MS degree in Computer Science, working in parallel molecular dynamics code (HPC) with proteins and amino acid molecules as test cases in distributed Grid Computing environments (<a href="http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1897/2545?sid=17918597-acc4-44d6-9a98-b5be0c4037c4">paper</a>). Prior to that, she has been a researcher at the <a href="https://www.isical.ac.in/">Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata</a> (worked in data structure and network algorithms), and then a software engineer at Siemens, Kolkata.

<p>She is an Indian-born US citizen, immigrated to USA in 2005 and lives in Palo Alto, California. Her hometown is in Kolkata, India, where she did BS(Math major; Phys, Chem minors) and MCA(Master in Computer Applications).
